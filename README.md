## üí° About 42 School

> The 42 Network is bound by a common system and set of values that allow students to free their creativity while they master self-discipline through project-based, practical learning. It is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school that proposes a new way of learning: no teachers, no books, students learning one from others (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. 42 Abu Dhabi is part of the 42 Global Network with 42 coding schools around the world. The "C Piscine" is a 26-day C programming bootcamp, and the last stage in the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

I hope this gives you a brief about the 42 Network ‚ò∫Ô∏è Dive in and feel free to look at my work.
