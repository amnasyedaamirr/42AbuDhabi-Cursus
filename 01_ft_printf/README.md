## 💡 About the project

> _This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments._

	This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version (more
	information below) of the printf function. Covers the conversions cspdiuxX%

For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/amnasyedaamirr/42AbuDhabi-Cursus/tree/main/Subjects).


## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```
or 

```shell
$ make all
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
